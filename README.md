# hello-world
So I figure this is probably not a bad way to start working on the rest of my life. Cheers!

Well I'm 33, probably one of the best musicians alive today, I live in Boston, and I have made it my mission to try to destigmatize drugs and the addicts that use them so that the rest of society stops assuming that just because a person uses it doesn't mean they are a bad person.
